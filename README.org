Simple Plugin provides a bridge between emacs and [[https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin][obsidian-exlicalidraw]], works both in ~orgmode~ and ~markdown~.

* Requirements

[[images/Screenshot.png]]

* Installation
** Manually Install
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-to-list 'load-path "[path-to-repo]")
(require 'emacs-obsidian-excalidraw)
#+end_src
* Configurations
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq emacs-obsidian-excalidraw-vault "[excalidraw vault name]")
(setq emacs-obsidian-excalidraw-vault-dir "[excalidraw file directory]")
(setq emacs-obsidian-excalidraw-image-format "png") ;; you should enable correspond format auto export in excalidraw
#+end_src
* Usage
+ =emacs-obsidian-excaliraw-create= will create a excalidraw file in vault, then auto open in obsidian
+ after finishing your drawing in obsidian, =Ctrl S= to trigger auto export
+ =M-x org-toggle-inline-images= or =M-x markdown-toggle-inline-images= will display your image
+ if you want to edit the image, toggle inline image again to display origin link, then =M-x emacs-obsidian-excalidraw-open-at-point= (will improve this later)
  
* Development todo list
+ [X] add png support
+ [X] add markdown file link support
+ [X] check multi-platform support: windows, mac
  + since using ~browse-url~ instead of ~browse-url-xdg-open~ to invoke obsidian, this methods should works cross platform
+ [ ] auto switch light/dark theme
+ [ ] auto redisplay image while file changed
+ [ ] open excalidraw directly without toggle link first
+ [ ] support different excalidraw file directory other than root in obsidian
